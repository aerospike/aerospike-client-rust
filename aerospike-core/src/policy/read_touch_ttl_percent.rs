/// ReadTouchTTLPercent determines how record TTL (time to live) is affected on reads. When enabled, the server can
/// efficiently operate as a read-based LRU cache where the least recently used records are expired.
/// The value is expressed as a percentage of the TTL sent on the most recent write such that a read
/// within this interval of the recordâ€™s end of life will generate a touch.
///
/// For example, if the most recent write had a TTL of 10 hours and read_touch_ttl_percent is set to
/// 80, the next read within 8 hours of the record's end of life (equivalent to 2 hours after the most
/// recent write) will result in a touch, resetting the TTL to another 10 hours.
/// Supported in server v8+.
